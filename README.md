# EFFICIENT POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM
Our course project, titled "Efficient Power Supply System," focuses on creating a smart
and effective solution for managing electricity. The main aim is to make sure that people
receive reliable and sustainable power in an organized way. We're implementing a
computer program that automates different important tasks related to electricity. This
includes efficiently managing information about electricity companies, optimizing how
power flows through cities using smart algorithms, and making sure that billing for
electricity is clear and fair. By doing all this, our project aims to contribute to building a
power supply system that is not only reliable but also smart and well-organized, making
sure everyone gets the electricity they need in the best possible way.
